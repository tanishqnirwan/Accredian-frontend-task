# Referral Page Frontend

**This frontend project is an assignment for the MERN Stack Intern position at Accredian. The service is deployed at [https://acc-frontend-nu.vercel.app/](https://acc-frontend-nu.vercel.app/)**

## About the Project

This frontend is built using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** with the **Ant Design (antd)** UI library. SVGs from the provided Figma design were used as needed to complete the UI. Despite the tight schedule due to exams, the required functionality for the assignment has been implemented.
